# 🖼️ Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption Tool 🛡️

Welcome to the Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption Tool! This tool allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using pixel manipulation techniques. It's a fun and simple way to secure your images!

## How it Works 🤔
The program performs encryption and decryption operations by manipulating the pixels of the image. It applies a basic mathematical operation to each pixel, such as swapping pixel values or adding a key value.

## Getting Started 🚀
To use the Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption Tool, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install pillow`.
4. Run the `pixel_manipulation_encryption.py` file.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt and decrypt images.

## Example 🌟
Let's say you have an image named `example_image.png` that you want to encrypt and decrypt. Here's how you can do it using the Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption Tool:

1. **Encrypt the Image:**
Enter the path to the image you want to encrypt: example_image.png
Enter the encryption key: 5

🎉 The image `example_image.png` will be encrypted successfully!

2. **Decrypt the Image:**
After encryption, the program automatically decrypts the image using the decryption key. You just need to confirm the decryption key when prompted.

Enter the decryption key: 5

🎉 The image `example_image.png` will be decrypted successfully!
